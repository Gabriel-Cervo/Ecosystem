# Simulating the Ecosystem

## Running the simulation
    
Know that you learned everything from here, we can start simulating our ecosystem!! The simulation here will be very simple. Let me explain how the simulation will work:
 
- All animals feel hungry, when they reach a certain percentage, they start searching for food.
- Herbivorous animals eat the plants.
- Carnivorous animals eat the herbivorous ones.
- When animals are tired, they sleep. You may see carnivorous a lot more often staying in the same place.
- When a animal can't find food, he dies of hunger
- Animals reproduce, but it depends on how many of them are not starving. For each two animals, another one is born.
- Plants are always growing from the ground
 
 You can change the runSimulation variable from 0 (not running) to 1 (running), that way you can test new types of animals and plants!
 Very simple, huh? They key here is to balance the number between each type of animals and plants, not letting them starve.
 The simulation is all yours now! Enjoy testing new combations of animals and plants!
 
 + Callout(Jo√£o):
    Hey, WWDC! Thank you for taking your time to see this playground. Hope I have been able to encourage you to look for more info on the subject spoken here. Take care and good luck in the simulation!
