# Plants
    
The plants are the biggest and one of the most diverse group of living beings on the planet. They are the basis of terrestrial ecosystems. Plants also provide us a substantial part of oxygen, which we need to survive, so it's important to take care of them!!
 
- Callout(Did you know? ðŸ’¡): Trees are a plant! Some people don't know this because they are big, but in fact, they are a very large plant!
