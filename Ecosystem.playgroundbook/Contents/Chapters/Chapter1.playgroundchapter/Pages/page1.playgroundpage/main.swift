 # Welcome to Ecosystem!
 
 - callout(João): Hey! I'm glad you're here! You wan't to know more about ecosystems? That's great!

+ callout(João): Shortly you will learn all everything about how a ecosystem works, from the importance of plants all the way to carnivores. We will build and *try* to simulate our own ecosystem too! But if things go wrong, I won't take responsability...
 
 * callout(WWDC): 🙄
 
 - callout(João): Come on, i promise it will be fun!
 
 + callout(João): But first, you may be wondering...

 ### What is a ecosystem and why should I even care?
 
   According to Vanessa dos Santos, ecosystem is a set of communities that live in a specific place and interact with each other and with the environment, constituting a stable, balanced and self-sufficient system.\
    That being said, I bet you already saw one! In fact, **you live in a ecosystem!** It might be different from mine or from someone across your country, there's a plenty of them on the planet, which all of them have different sizes and locations. It's basically our home, but in a larger scale... I think you get the importance 😉\
    I could talk here all day about this, but since I don't wan't to take too much of your time, let's focus on how land ecosystems works. We are gonna start talking about... **plants** 🌿
