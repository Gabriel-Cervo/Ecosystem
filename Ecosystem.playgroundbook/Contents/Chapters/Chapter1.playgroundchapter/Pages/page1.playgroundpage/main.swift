 # Welcome to Ecosystem!
 
 - callout(JoÃ£o): Hey! I'm glad you're here! You want to know more about ecosystems? That's great!

+ callout(JoÃ£o): Shortly you will learn all about how an ecosystem works, from the importance of plants all the way to carnivores. We will build and *try* to simulate our own ecosystem too! But if things go wrong, I won't take responsibility...
 
 * callout(WWDC): ðŸ™„
 
 - callout(JoÃ£o): Come on, I promise it will be fun! But first, you may be wondering...

 ### What is an ecosystem and why should I even care?
 
   According to the professor of Biology Lana MagalhÃ£es, ecosystem is a set of living organisms that live and interact with each other and with the environment, constituting a stable, balanced and self-sufficient system.\
    That being said, I bet you already saw one! In fact, **you live in an ecosystem!** It might be different from mine or from someone across your country, there're plenty of them on the planet, all having different sizes and locations. It's basically our home, but in a larger scale... I think you get the importance ðŸ˜Š \
    I could talk here all day about this, but since I don't want to take too much of your time, let's focus on how land ecosystems works. We are gonna start talking about... **plants** ðŸŒ¿
 - Note: All info here will be very summarized to be fast to read while also talking about important points. The objective here is to motivate you to search and learn more on your own ðŸ˜‰
